Agent is independent object that implements all of the functions necessary to 
implement the simulation. This includes movement, change of infection status,
possible death, etc.

Agent manager can be used to run simulation for some number of agents by calling
methods to update agent's position and infection status.

Simulation manager runs the simulation for all of the agent managers and
interfaces with the database

Could have ability to interface with external databases that are provided by
the user, both for outputting the simulation data and for inputting simulation
parameters (like mobility data) or testing simulation against real-world data.

May help to have command line tools to run the simulation as well.
