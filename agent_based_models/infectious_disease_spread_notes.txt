Types of Models:

Compartmental models i.e. SIR, SID, SIRV, etc.
Probabilistic models (Markov chains)
Agent-based models, but will probably use Markov chain techniques


IDEA: Use agent-based technique, but the underlying state transition
    diagram will be approximately a Markov chain over the SIR, etc. states.
    Since using agent-based model, the Markov assumption will not hold though


Disease parameters:

beta - number of susceptible people infected per unit time
gamma - number of infected people recovered per unit time
d - number of infected people who die per unit time
r - number of recovered people reinfected per unit time
vs - number of susceptible people vaccinated per unit time
vr - number of recovered people vaccinated per unit time
rv - number of vaccinated people reinfected per unit time


Human motion simulation:

use real mobility data and generate mobility matrix for probability
of movement from one square to another and use inverse transform method (? maybe)
to randomly walk the agent between squares.

Inter-city travel will have to be simulated in a different way using either
the Newtonian inverse distance-squared model or some more complicated model.

Infection probability in a given square will be proportional to the number of
people in the square divided by the square size times some constant. Possibly
use the Venables distance here.


Collecting Data from Simulation:

Need for a publish-subscribe framework in order to allow scalability of data
recording, and for flexibility and user-definition of data to be recorded. This
will make it usable for many different types of agent-based models.
